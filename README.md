# SSA - Skyrmion size analyzer script
A matlab script to analyse MOKE and simulation images of magnetic skyrmions.

## Info
The script is based on another skyrmion size analyzer by Bennert Smit. The original script is from his master's thesis at https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/controlling-the-energy-barrier-for-skyrmion-nucleation-with-ga-io. This is a modified version of that with rudimentary capabilities for stripe domain width calculation, albeit this is implemented in a sketchy way and should be used very cautiously.
